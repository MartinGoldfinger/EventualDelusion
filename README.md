Testing a Final Fantasy 1 type battle screen in Python 3 with tkinter, images courtesy of Final Fantasy IV Complete Collection on PSP.

This was born out of The Complete Python Masterclass videos on Udemy. 
The Instructor spend a good while on tkinter for GUI programming and 
classes and I put what I learned in both to modify the text game built

character.py - contains the Character class and attack_phase and heal_self
whichare the brains behind the buttons in the main window

main.py - builds the main window and displays all the images and frames
and has the order of operations forall the function calls that are 
stored in the Character class
